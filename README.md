Restoar9x

A fork of GISAH by the original writer.

=====

System Optimizer written in DOS Batch.

This tool is meant for machines that run Windows 95, 98, ME, or 2000. Every now and then, I work on machines that have these operating systems and most of the tools that I rely on usually aren't compatible. So I built one.

The scripts ultimately make system calls and have basic commands to interact with directories. It was heavily inspired by Bleachbit.
